## Flair Ecommerce Store

This project is a Fullstack application, Flair Ecommerce Store, a fully functional online shopping platform.

**Key Technologies:**

-   **Frontend:**  Next.js (likely in a separate repository)
-   **Backend:**  Next.js (API routes)
-   **Content Management:**  Sanity.io with custom studio for product data management
-   **Payments:**  Stripe integration for secure checkout processing
-   **Styling:**  Tailwind CSS for a responsive and customizable UI

**Features:**

-   Interactive and responsive user interface for a smooth browsing experience (developed in the frontend repository)
-   Organized product data management through a dedicated Sanity.io studio
-   Seamless integration with Stripe for secure checkout with shipping cost calculation and invoice generation
-   Additional functionalities might include user accounts, wishlists, and order history (depending on implementation)

**Getting Started (Developers Only):**

**1. Prerequisites**

-   Node.js and npm installed ([https://nodejs.org/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download))
-   A Stripe account ([invalid URL removed])

**2. Clone the Repository**
```
git clone https://your-github-repo.com/ecommerce-app.git
```
**3. Install Dependencies**
```
cd ecommerce-app
npm install
```
**4. Obtain Stripe API Keys**

-   **Create a Stripe account**  if you haven't already ([invalid URL removed]).
-   **Log in**  to your Stripe dashboard.
-   Navigate to  **Developers > API keys**.
-   **Create two API keys:**
    -   **Publishable Key:**  Used on the client-side (frontend) to interact with Stripe elements.
    -   **Secret Key:**  Used on the server-side (backend) to process payments securely.
-   **Store these keys securely:**
    -   **Never**  commit them to your version control system (e.g., Git).
    -   Consider using environment variables or a secrets management solution for secure storage and retrieval in your backend environment.

**5. Development Server**
```
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server, allowing you to work on the backend logic. You'll likely need to run the frontend development server (in a separate repository) concurrently for a complete development experience.

**6. Build for Production**
```
npm run build
```
This generates an optimized production build for deployment.

**Additional Considerations:**

-   **Test Payments:**  Before deploying to production, thoroughly test your Stripe integration using Stripe's test mode.
